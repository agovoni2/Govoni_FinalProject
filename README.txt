Welcome to Protocol Breach!

Blast the hacker bots trying to infiltrate your network and score points in this wave-based twin-stick-shooter. Newly spawned enemies will appear green for about a second. During this time they can't take or deal damage, giving you a moment to reposition at the start of each wave.

Thank you for checking out my game and downloading it for the optimal experience!


Controls:
WASD to move. Aim with the mouse and press Mouse1 to fire.


Enemy types:
[Yellow enemies] will slowly follow the player, inching forward to do you harm. Weak alone, watch out for swarms.

[Orange enemies] are a rather sedentary sort. They don't move at all and can't be defeated until every other enemy type in the wave is defeated.

[Red enemies] are big brutes that can push you around and deal damage. They take two shots to beat and will bounce off walls. They'll also randomly leave the playing field and despawn. Blast 'em before they leave to get a big boost to your score!
